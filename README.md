# Minimal-Weather
This is a simple weather app with a minimalistic design. It's build using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I've made it completely responsive for devices of all sizes. You can open it in you phone's browser and then save the page to your Home to use it as a web application.
For deploying it in Heroku I've used Node and Express. 
The weather data is fetched only for a valid city name from accuweather's free REST API.
This data is then displayed on the client side. 
I've also built the same app without Node and Express which only runs if you download all the files.
NOTE: The free API only allows a limited number of requests in 24 hours. If the requests exceed the specified number, the app may stop working for some time.
